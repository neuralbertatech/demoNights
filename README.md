**demoNights**

This repository hosts the code and resources for Demo Nights, a recurring event series by NAT.

Each Demo Night features hands-on projects built with emerging technologies — ranging from hardware demos to software experiments. This repo serves as a central location where all code and instructions for each demo can be found.

**How to Use This Repo**

- Each Demo Night project is organized in its own folder.
- Check the README inside each project folder for details on setup, usage, and requirements for that specific demo.

**NAT**

NAT (previously NeurAlbertaTech), also known as the Network for Applied Technology, is Alberta’s largest neurotechnology innovator / education network. 

It supports the education, development, and community around neurotechnologies (brain-computer interfaces, biosensors, etc.). 

**What are Demo Nights?**

Demo Nights are events organized by NAT where members or participants showcase small hands-on projects or demonstrations — often with emerging tech, sensors, bio-tech, wearables, etc.

They are meant to be learning/sharing events: you build something, show it, explain it, get feedback, inspire others.

They often involve making new interactive hardware, exploring sensors, etc.
