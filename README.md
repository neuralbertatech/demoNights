## What is this?

This repository hosts the code and resources for **Demo Nights**, a recurring event series by **NAT**.

Each Demo Night features hands-on projects built with emerging technologies — ranging from hardware demos to software experiments. The repo serves as a **central location** where all code and instructions for each demo can be found.

---

## How to use the repo

- Each Demo Night project is organized in its **own folder**.
- Check the **README inside each project folder** for setup, usage, and requirements for that specific demo.

## What are Demo Nights?

**Demo Nights** are events organized by **NAT** where members or participants showcase small hands-on projects or demonstrations — often with emerging tech, sensors, bio-tech, wearables, etc.

They’re meant to be learning/sharing events: you build something, show it, explain it, get feedback, and inspire others.  
They often involve making new interactive hardware, exploring sensors, and more.
